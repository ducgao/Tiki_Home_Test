# Tiki Home Test

This is an assignment from Tiki.vn.
The simple application to show deals and count down the time left, and also remove expired deals.


## Support libraries
I'm using RecycleView and CardView from android support to make the application follow material design

## Programming language

This project is using Kotlin.
I never use Kotlin before, this is the first time. I have a plan to read and learn about Kotlin after I finish the Clean Code.
